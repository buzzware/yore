* log warning and above to STDERR
* report used with all detail levels, all sent to log ?
* log warning and above sent to report

Perhaps :
* one logger. 
* Report includes info+
* STDERR includes warning+

Write log splitter that looks like a logger, and is created with an array of other loggers.
All log actions are replicated on the array of loggers

loggers :
ConsoleLogger: (debug-info to STDOUT,warning+ to STDERR) (no timestamp)
ReportLogger: (info+ to report file) standard logger class (minimised timestamp)
SystemLogger: all levels to /var/log (rolling file) SysLogLogger ? (standard timestamp)
